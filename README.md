This is the Singularity recipe to build an OpenSUSE 4.2 image with R v3.6.1 + BiocManager.

##  Building image
To build the image run

```
bash ./script.sh
```

## Requirements
Singularity v2.6+ is needed to build the container. However as of today, only version 2.6.0 will work on `lanec1.compbio.cs.cmu.edu`

I am nothing but a humble programmer creating the container for these wonderful apps.
